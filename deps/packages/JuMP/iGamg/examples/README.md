# JuMP Examples

This folder contains a number of examples using JuMP.

## Note

These examples are for the latest JuMP master branch. 

If you're using JuMP 0.18 (or if you get an error about `MathOptInterface` not defined), you're probably after
[the examples for the `release-0.18` branch](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl/tree/release-0.18/examples).
