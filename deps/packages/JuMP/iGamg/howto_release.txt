This note serves as developer documentation for the JuMP release process, which
has accumulated a number of manual steps.

Steps for a new major (0.xx) release:

- Update NEWS.md
- Create release-0.xx branch
- Update version and branches in README.md
- Check that CI passes on release branch

/!\ When creating a tag, check that it is not created on a commit with
    `[ci skip]`, see https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/issues/965
