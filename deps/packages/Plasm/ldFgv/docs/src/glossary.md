# Glossary of types

### Points
Alias declation of LAR-specific data structure.
Dense `Matrix` ``M\times N`` to store the position of *vertices* (0-cells)
of a *cellular complex*. The number of rows ``M`` is the dimension 
of the embedding space. The number of columns ``N`` is the number of 0-cells.

### Cells
Alias declation of LAR-specific data structure.
Dense `Array` of `Array` to store the indices of vertices of `P-cells`
of a cellular complex. 
The linear space of `P-chains` is generated by `Cells` as a basis.
Simplicial `P-chains` have `P+1` vertex indices for `cell` element in `Cells` array.
Cuboidal `P-chains` have ``2^P`` vertex indices for `cell` element in `Cells` array.
Other types of chain spaces may have different numbers of vertex indices for `cell` 
element in `Cells` array.

### Chain
Alias declation of LAR-specific data structure.
Binary `SparseVector` to store the coordinates of a `chain` of `N-cells`. It is
`nnz=1` with `value=1` for the coordinates of an *elementary N-chain*, constituted by 
a single *N-chain*.

### ChainOp
Alias declation of LAR-specific data structure. 
`SparseMatrix` in *Compressed Sparse Column* format, contains the coordinate 
representation of an operator between linear spaces of `p-chains`. 
Operators ``p``-``Boundary : ``p``-``Chain -> ``(p-1)``-``Chain``
and ``p``-``Coboundary : ``p``-``Chain -> ``(p+1)``-``Chain`` are typically stored as 
`ChainOp` with elements in ``\{-1,0,1\}`` or in ``\{0,1\}``, for 
*signed* and *unsigned* operators, respectively.

### ChainComplex
Alias declation of LAR-specific data structure. It is a 
1-dimensional `Array` of `ChainOp` that provides storage for either the 
*chain of boundaries* (from `D` to `0`) or the transposed *chain of coboundaries* 
(from `0` to `D`), with `D` the dimension of the embedding space, which may be either 
``R^2`` or ``R^3``.

#### LAR_Model
Alias declation of LAR-specific data structure.
`LAR_Model` is a pair (*Geometry*, *Topology*), where *Geometry* is stored as 
`Points`, and *Topology* is stored as `Array` of `Cells`. The number of differents
 `Cells` objects (i.e. *Skeletons*) of a `n`-dimensional cellular complex goes from `0` to `n`.

#### LAR
Alias declation of LAR-specific data structure.
`LAR_Model` is a pair (*Geometry*, *Topology*), where *Geometry* is stored as 
`Points`, and *Topology* as`Cells`. 

#### Hpc
Alias declation of LAR-specific data structure. 
`Hpc` stands for *Hierarchical Polyhedral Complex* and is the geometric data structure 
used by `PLaSM` (Programming LAnguage for Solid Modeling). See the Wiley's book 
[*Geometric Programming for Computer-Aided Design*]
(https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/0470013885) and its 
current `Python` library [*https://github.com/plasm-language/pyplasm*]
