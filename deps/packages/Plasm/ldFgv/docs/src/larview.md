# Viewing cellular complexes

## Introduction

Visualization of geometric and/or topological data is a must for a project that concerns geometric modeling, numerical simulations, and/or graphics rendering of simulation results. The `Plasm.jl` package provides visualization services to `LinearAlgebraicRepresentation.jl`, the julia ongoing implementation of the *LAR (Linear Algebraic Representation)* scheme for solid and geometric modeling, well-based on linear algebra and algebraic concepts of *cellular* and *chain complexes*.  

`LinearAlgebraicRepresentation` is implemented using only *dense* and *sparse arrays*, and without need of fancy complicated data structures that are usual for *non-manifold solid modeling*. LAR has a large semantic coverage,  including geometric and topological modeling, domain modeling for physical simulations, geographical mapping, computer graphics, computer vision and robotics.

Visualization of data structures generated by the Julia package [*`LinearAlgebraicRepresentation`*](https://github.com/cvdlab/LinearAlgebraicRepresentation.jl) are currently produced by making use of the Python package [*`pyplasm`*](https://github.com/plasm-language/pyplasm), the current implementation of the geometric language [`PLaSM`]() (Programming LAnguage for Solid Modeling). See the Wiley's book 
[*Geometric Programming for Computer-Aided Design*]
(https://www.amazon.com/Geometric-Programming-Computer-Aided-Design/dp/0471899429) for more information.

## Types for data and viewing operations

To get a proper view of data types used by `Plasm` and `LinearAlgebraicRepresentation` packages, look at the
[Glossary](glossary.md) document.


## List of currently available primitives

The functions of the package can be classified in three subsets.   

The first group contains functions to return *Python lists* of either `Cells` or `Points`, according to the `pyplasm` semantics;

	cells2py(cells::Cells)::PyObject

	points2py(V::Points)::PyObject

	mkpol(verts::Points, cells::Cells)::Hpc

The second one is the set of *method implementations* for the `view` function, that either directly displays a `Hpc` object, or generates and *displays* this argument starting from different combinations of `Plasm` and `LinearAlgebraicRepresentation` types;

	view(hpc::Hpc)

	view(V::Points, CV::Cells)

	view(model::LAR_Model)

	view(pair::Tuple{Points,Cells})
	
The third group generates an `Hpc` object, to be subsequently displayed by some `view` call.

	hpc_exploded( model::LAR_Model)(sx=1.2, sy=1.2, sz=1.2)::Hpc

	lar2hpc(V::Points, CV::Cells)::Hpc

	lar2hpc(model::LAR_Model)::Hpc

	lar2exploded_hpc(V::Points,CV::Cells)::Hpc

Another set of methods will be dedicated to *display cell indices* of various cell complexes, using different *colors* for each `Cells` object, but it was not yet been ported to *Julia*.
